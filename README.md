# Basic Progressive Web App in React

## Progressive Web Apps bring the best of both worlds.

They can be easily created using HTML, CSS & Javascript. They can be run on all browsers, operating systems and devices. PWA's also have access to native features: they can work offline, they can be installed to your mobile device home screen and they have access to mobile features.

## The numbers don't lie.

### Companies that have launched Progressive Web Apps have seen impressive results.

Twitter saw a 65% increase in pages per session, 75% more Tweets, and a 20% decrease in bounce rate, all while reducing the size of their app by over 97%.
